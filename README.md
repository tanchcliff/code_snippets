# Code Snippets

repo of code snippets.
mainly scala and python stuff.

### Scala

contains snippets to do different operations:

  - reformat numerical columns of dataframes for display (remove exponentials)
  - set nullable property of columns in dataset
  - save meta data of parquet files
  - tokenisation of dataset (instead of using hashing algo which results in hash collisions when applied on a large dataset)
  - unpivot a dataframe
  - timer class for timing code execution durations
